## Horiseon Marketing Refactor Goal
This project's goal was to refactor Horiseon Marketings webpage to have semantic html. I also condensed and reorganized the css by using css element selectors in place of the excess css selector classes. I had to change the title, clean up the html and remove all of the additional class selectors referenced in the css stylesheet.
